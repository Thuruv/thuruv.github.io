As the time passes by, you'll want life and its components to be simpler. Instead of a complex day, Oh My God, Please let it be simpler becomes the quasi-midlife crisis fueled motto for me. Though half of me yearns for a chaos, other half expects things be simpler. Thats when I met [Arthur Schopenhauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer). Dwelling in life to upbring it with utmost sincerety(?!) with the company of Osho & nietzsche, Schopenhauer opens (rather shuts) the door to a different realm.
