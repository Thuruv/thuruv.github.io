May be I cannot afford understand the whole point of writing a blog post
because just as I am still affraid to do so when seeing some really 
nice blogs. But I insisted myself, I should express to a space what
I know, Even though its Nothing/Stupid/Confusingly Idiotic Stuff.

Well, with dreams shattered and restlessness kills, boredom 
will germinate useful devil inside you. That grows upon itself 
and perform a fission process on its own with whatever/wherever
you got unavoidable shits.

The Unceasing habit of reading, brought me to someplaces which
I can pat myself for doing that before I die yet that sufficly gave me 
something to write on my own.

Also, sometimes I got confused with the overwhelming topics and methods everyone out handling.
