Out of the dark, thunder rumbling work days, a mere light came for me in a day's midnight of this month. 
That too, a severe cause of python. As python has the elixir simplicity to use and its adoption for almost 
any work, and 100% of what I'm doing for earning, I enjoyed the possible easiness of automating  my work
day-to-day and everything went well.

After a week of me got the opportunity to enter into a real world of analytics, jumped directly from operations,
I got a sidekick project of creating a tool to extract some random records from the given file.
Initially the project name itself was utterly terryfying to me. "Randomization queue picker" or something. But my concentration was distracted 
when I'm permitted to use the conference room 54" Monitor, I watched "Suicide Squad" #2 trailer in the meantime.

Once i got the requirements, I promised them to show a mere working prototype witihin a week. Exhausted, went back to my system and began to navigate my usual RSS sites. Gotcha.
